# **What is Covest Finance** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39422342/167291196-96b7f01b-902c-4d9b-9e76-9047ea4f6d98.png" width="45" />

Covest Finance is a risk-sharing protocol that enables the seamless transfer of risk between parties in the network by replacing traditional agreements with self-executing code stored on the blockchain.

# **Blockchain-based Insurance**

Rather than relying on outdated, centralized structures and processes, Covest Finance enables the seamless transfer of risk between parties in the network. We do this by replacing traditional agreements with self-executing code stored on the blockchain, thereby ensuring that the terms of all contracts are upheld.

# **Alternative Capital Source**

Our smart contract technology tokenizes insurance portfolios to access to different sources of capital regardless of the insurance risk, speed, and complexity allowing risk owners, brokers, insurance carriers, and reinsurers to unlock liquidity in their portfolios.
